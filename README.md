# Goals / Outcomes ✨
- Using state
- Leveraging existing dependencies

&nbsp;
# Pre-requisites ✅
- Do not add additional dependencies

&nbsp;
# Requirements 📖
- Add dark-mode switching functionality to the *existing* dark-mode button
  - Utilise the *existing* dark-mode styles by adding `bg-dark` and `text-light` classes to the root `html` element
- When in Dark mode:
  - The button icon should be `faSun`
  - The button icon colour should be `(#FFA500)`. You can use the `color` prop on the `Icon` component.
- Add column classes to the two paragraphs to get them to sit side by side
- Add bootstrap classes to the button and form fields to style them appropriately
- Add functionality to store the contents of the form fields and display them in a modal
  - Use the existing modal component
  - Modal should show/hide based on state

&nbsp;
# Think about 💡
- How we would use Dark mode on other potential routes/components in a bigger application. Would your solution work for this?
- How we can apply a class to the `html` DOM element

# What's Already Been Done 🏁
- Basic app UI (mobile responsive)
- Dark mode and light mode styles/themes
